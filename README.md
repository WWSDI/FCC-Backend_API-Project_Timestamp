## new Date()
Return value
Calling new Date() (the Date()constructor) returns a Date object. If called with an invalid date string, it returns a Date object whose toString() method returns the literal string Invalid Date.

Calling the Date() function (without the new keyword) returns a string representation of the current date and time, exactly as new Date().toString() does. Any arguments given in a Date() function call (without the new keyword) are ignored; regardless of whether it’s called with an invalid date string — or even called wth any arbitrary object or other primitive as an argument — it always returns a string representation of the current date and time.
